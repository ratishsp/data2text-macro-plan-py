Xavier Nady hit his second homer of the game , a three - run shot in the 12th inning , and the Pittsburgh Pirates overcame a horrific ninth and another potential collapse for a 12 - 11 win Monday night , ruining Atlanta 's home opener . The Braves took advantage of four walks and a huge defensive blunder to erase the Pirates ' 9 - 4 lead . But Nady , who led off the eighth with a homer , lined a 2 - 0 pitch from Blaine Boyer ( 0 - 1 ) into the right-field seats with two outs and two aboard in the 12th	True
Franquelis Osoria ( 0 - 1 ) pitched three innings for his first major league win .

With the game tied at 4 , the Pirates teed off on Acosta in the eighth	True

Yunel Escobar , taking over a shortstop for Edgar Renteria , went 3 - for - 4 with three RBIs but made a costly throwing error that allowed the tying run to score in the seventh	True
Longtime Braves catcher Javy Lopez , who retired after a failed comeback attempt in spring training , threw out the ceremonial first pitch . Then it was Glavine 's turn to throw pitches that counted , cheered by the same fans who booed him lustily after a bitter contract dispute with Atlanta management led him to sign with the Mets . Glavine was helped out by new Braves center fielder Mark Kotsay , who made a play reminiscent of the guy he replaced . Kotsay threw out Jack Wilson at home to end the fourth	True
